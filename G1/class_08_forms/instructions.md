We add a new page to the app called `CheckOutAddress` which will be used to collect the user's address information. This page will have a form that will collect the user's address, city, country etc. After the user submits the form, the app will send the address to the server and save it in the database.

## Installing React Hook Form

Unlike other frameworks, React has a bunch of different ways to handle forms. One of the most popular is called React Hook Form. We will be using this to handle the form as an example of working with forms in React.

To install React Hook Form, run the following command:

```bash
npm install react-hook-form
```

Aside from working with forms, in this example we can showcase making a POST request with axios, and fetching orders from the server.
