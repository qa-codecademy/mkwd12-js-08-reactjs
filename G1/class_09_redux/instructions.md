We add Redux as example for state management in React.

## Installing React Hook Form

Redux is one of most popular state management libraries for React. Even though in latest version of React, we can use React Context API or other tools for state management, Redux is still a popular choice for many developers, and is part of almost all longer lasting React based projects.

To install Redux, run the following command:

```bash
npm install redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```
