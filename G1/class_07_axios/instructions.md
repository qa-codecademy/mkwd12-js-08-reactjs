# Class agenda

This is the class we stop using mock data and start using real data from the API.

## Install Axios

1. npm install axios

Axios is a library that makes it easy to make HTTP requests.

## Starting the server

In the general server folder we have a plain NestJS server, providing a simple API. We will use this server to fetch data from the API. We need PostgreSQL to run the server.
