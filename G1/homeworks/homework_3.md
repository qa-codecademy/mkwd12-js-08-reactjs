# Homework 3 - Add routing

###### Deadline: 20.06.2024

## Task 1: Implement routing

Each page should have a different URL. For example, the home page should be at `/`, the page about Europe should be at `/europe`, the page about Asia should be at `/asia`, etc.

Users should be able to directly view some specific page (e.g. Asia page) by typing the URL in the browser's address bar.

## Task 2: Show countries based on continent

The countries you created in the previous task should be visible in the other pages, filtered by continent. For example, the Europe page should show only countries from Europe, Asia page should show only countries from Asia, etc.

Show basic information about the countries, e.g. name, capital, population, etc.

For landlocked countries, show green border or background color.
For non-landlocked countries, show blue border or background color.

## FAQs

Q: How should I display the countries?
A: You can use a list or a table or cards/boxes to show the countries.
