# Homework 6 - Complete the trip planner

###### Deadline: 08.07.2024

## Task 1: Add a new page for adding trip information

Create a new page with a form to add trip information.

The form should have the following fields:

- Passenger name
- Passenger email
- budget
- passport number
- comments

At the end of the form, the user should be able to submit the trip information.

## Task 2: View planned trips

Create a new page with a list of planned trips.

Each trip should have the following information:

- Passenger name
- budget
- comments
- List of countries (to be) visited with the number of days to visit each country.

As we don't have ability to save this trip information in a database, feel free to use localStorage to store the trip information.

On page load, the page should display the list of planned trips (fetched from localStorage).

## FAQs

None at the moment.
