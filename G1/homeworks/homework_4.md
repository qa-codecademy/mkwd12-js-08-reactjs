# Homework 4 - Fetching data from an API

In this homework, we are going to fetch data from an API and display it in our React app. We are going to use Rest counties API to get the data: [https://restcountries.com/](https://restcountries.com/)

###### Deadline: 23.06.2024

## Task 1: Fetch data from the API

Countries should be fetched from the API and displayed in the page. The API will return the data in JSON format.

## Task 2: Use proper endpoint for each page

Go though the API documentation and find the endpoints for each page. Use the endpoints to fetch the data for each page, and each feature to limit the work on the client side, and move all complex tasks to the server.

Example:

https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{name} - let's you search for a country by name

https://restcountries.com/v3.1/region/{region} - let's you search for a country by region

etc.

## FAQs
