# Homework 5 - Creating a trip planner

###### Deadline: 30.06.2024

## Task 1: Enabling the user to create a trip plan

Add ability for user to add a country to the trip plan. The user should be able to select a country from any list of countries, shown on any of the pages.

A country should not be added twice to the trip plan.

## Task 2: Adding a new page for the trip plan

Add a new page for the trip plan where the user can see his trip plan in a list of countries.

On the right side of each country there should be an input with the number of days to visit a certain country. The days number can't be less than 1 and more than 30.

Add a delete button right next to the days counter. When pressed, the country is removed from the trip plan.
